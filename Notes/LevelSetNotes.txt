For each face:
    1. Make copy of mesh.
    2. Unite neighbour faces that have same normal.
    3. Add all of their IDs to a set() to make sure they aren't chosen again.
    4. Go into edit mode with the copy.
    5. Add a plane with the same normal and same position as the deleted face.
        a) To get one vector perpendicular to normal, calculate 2D perpendicular.
        b) Use cross product to get another perpendicular vector.
        c) Use these perpendicular vectors and the mesh's "radius" to find the plane's corners.
    6. Select the plane (and NOTHING ELSE).
    7. Do Ctrl+F => Intersect (Knife)
    8. Delete all vertices that do not lie on the plane. 
    9. Delete the original face.
    10. If anything remains (otherwise, just add face to "keep" mesh):
        a) Project the result into the plane to get 2D coordinates.
        b) Calculate its 2D visual hull.
        c) Overlap the 2D visual hull with the projected/2D original face.
        d) If intersection exists, add it to "discard" mesh.
        e) If difference exists, add it to "keep" mesh.
