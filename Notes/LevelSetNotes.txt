For each face:
    1. Make copy of mesh.
    2. Perform a limit dissolve.
    3. Now, for each face in the mesh, make ANOTHER copy of the whole mesh and continue.
    4. Bisect the copy with face.normal and with a coord of face.vertices[0].co
    5. Delete the polygon corresponding to the original face.
    6. Get the set of all "polygons" that remain.
    7. If anything remains (otherwise, just add orig face to "keep" mesh):
        a) Project the result into the plane to get 2D coordinates.
        b) Calculate its 2D visual hull.
        c) Overlap the 2D visual hull with the projected/2D original face.
        d) If intersection exists, add it to "discard" mesh.
        e) If difference exists, add it to "keep" mesh.
        
face has a .normal attribute
face has a .index but this can change.

Good:
    1. Make copy of mesh.
    2. Perform a limit dissolve.
    3. Now, for each face in the mesh, make ANOTHER copy of the whole mesh and continue.
    4. Bisect the copy with face.normal and with a coord of face.vertices[0].co
    5. Delete the polygon corresponding to the original face.
    7. If anything remains (otherwise, just add orig face to "keep" mesh):

Unsure:

    6. Get the set of all "polygons" that remain.
